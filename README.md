# Lirus
Lirus is a Pygame window that looks like a web pop-up of Linus Sebastian trying to give you some tech tips, but in reality will bomb your default browser with tabs of https:linus-sex.tips.

NOTE:

-You will need Pygame to debug and run the code for yourself

-You will need the jpeg listed with the python file

-I have no clue how to Pygame 90% of the code has been copy-pasted from Stack Overflow and I sincerely apologize if I commented anything incorrectly
